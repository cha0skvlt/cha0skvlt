## 👨‍💻 Evgeny Tomashkov — DevOps Engineer & LLM Integrator

> 📐 **Ordo ab Chao** 

---

I specialize in building **automated, production-ready systems** using modern DevOps and AI tools.  
My focus is on **declarative infrastructure**, **GPT-powered bots**, and **hands-off deployments**.

---

### 💡 Key Principles
- Infrastructure as Code — always reproducible  
- Minimal manual effort, maximal automation  
- Systems must explain themselves (Markdown, YAML, logs)  
- Bots should be *alive* — with structure, memory, and identity

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 15 years in Unix: Debian, Kali, FreeBSD 
- Python, Bash: scripting, parsing, backup automation  
- Apache2 / Nginx: reverse proxy, SSL termination  
- Docker: development & production containers  
- Ansible: infrastructure provisioning & orchestration  
- PostgreSQL / SQLite: REST APIs, bot backends, metrics  
- Cloud VDS: Terraform, deployment, scaling, monitoring  
- Zabbix, Prometheus + Grafana: metrics, alerts, dashboards  
- OpenAI API, Telegram API: LLMs, bots, auto-generation pipelines

---

### 🔧 What I Do
- Build Telegram bots of any complexity  
- Integrate GPT into real-world workflows  
- Automate infrastructure & CI/CD pipelines  
- Deliver containerized systems from zero to production
